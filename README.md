### Progress
- [x] Attempted to use RX8130
- [x] failed to use RX8130 :(
- [x] Succesfully pivoted to DS3121
- [x] realized RTC was unneccesary 
- [x] finished code
- [x] finished spahgetti point to point (with italian falg colored wires)
- [ ] ~~failed test in temperature chamber~~
- [x] ~~give up creating dew condensation after a PHD told us it would not work~~
- [x] Meanwhile, forced dew condensation in temperature chamber
- [x] Defined schematic of PCB with teensy stand in
- [x] replaced teensy with STM32F103
- [x] Finished schematic
- [x] routed PCB
- [x] Fine Tuned
- [x] Swagged out silkscreen
- [x] issued production order
- [x] finished progress list
- [ ] finished README and documentat...zzz

# AERONET-Heated-wet-sensor

## Heated Wet Sensor for the NASA AERONET program

![Ray tracing render](/IMG/DewDeleterPCB.PNG)

### Description
A PCB designed to cure NASA AERONET robots suffering from dew induced crepuscular narcolepsy (instruments remaining in standby due to dew on wet sensor). The PCB is Connected to temperature sensors, CIMEL control box and a heated wet sensor, in order to determine if the wet sensor is at risk of dew condensation. If so, turns on heater to prevent dew condensation. Determines dew risk by calculating dew point at BME280(atmospheric DP) and compares it to dew point calculated by temperature sensor underneath heated wet sensor(Sensor DP). Heats wet senor until sensor DP is higher than atmospheric DP. Formula used to calculate dew point:

Is mostly a "plug-and-play" design; does not need any programming or input from operator beyond initial code load. Runs on 12V and 1.5A power supply.

Designed as part of USNA-to-NASA internship. 

#### Initial code load prerequisites/software dependencies
* Arduino IDE
* Include libraries: bme280 by Bolder Flight, OneWire, and DallasTemperature
* SWD (Serial Wire Debug) upload mechinism

### Progress
- [x] Attempted to use RX8130
- [x] failed to use RX8130 :(
- [x] Succesfully pivoted to DS3121
- [x] realized RTC was unneccesary 
- [x] finished code
- [x] finished spahgetti point to point (with italian falg colored wires)
- [ ] ~~failed test in temperature chamber~~
- [x] ~~give up creating dew condensation after a PHD told us it would not work~~
- [x] Meanwhile, forced dew condensation in temperature chamber
- [x] Defined schematic of PCB with teensy stand in
- [x] replaced teensy with STM32F103
- [x] Finished schematic
- [x] routed PCB
- [x] Fine Tuned
- [x] Swagged out silkscreen
- [x] issued production order
- [x] finished progress list
- [ ] finished README and documentat...zzz
